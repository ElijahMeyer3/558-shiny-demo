```{r}
# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Load in an R.data file

load("data/movies.Rdata")
```

Explore the data below: 

```{r}

#add code here

```

Next, make a scatterplot to explore the relationship between `imdb_ratings` and `critics_score`

```{r}

#add code here

```

Now, what if we wanted to assess the relationship between `imdb_num_votes` and `imdb_ratings`? `imdb_ratings` and `critics_score`? Other variables? This is motivation to consider making a dynamic plot, and hosting it through shiny. 

We will start by creating a dynamic scatter plot that can explore the relationships between: `imdb_rating, imdb_num_votes, critics_score, audience_score, runtime`. We will progressivly update our shiny app to answer more complex problems as we go. Let's start with `movies_01-starter.R`.
